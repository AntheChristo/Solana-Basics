# Solana SolDevBasics Project

This project explores various actions within the Solana blockchain ecosystem, specifically through the `generate-keypair.ts` script. 

## generate-keypair.ts
The `generate-keypair.ts` file includes multiple functionalities for Solana blockchain interaction, such as generating key pairs. Portions of the code are commented out for clarity and can be activated by removing the `/*` and `*/` comment markers. This allows for easy customization and testing of different features within the same script.

### Usage
To use a specific function within `generate-keypair.ts`, navigate to the desired section and remove the comment markers surrounding it. This will enable the code block, making its functionality available for execution.

Please ensure you have the necessary Solana and Node.js dependencies installed before running any scripts.

Happy coding!
